# SwiftyFpl

SwiftyFpl is a simple package to work with garmin ```.fpl``` formats, aimed at Infinite Flight usage. It features an intelegent encoder that would resolve any issues that may arise from 2 objects with the same name.

## Usage

Using SwiftyFpl is as simple as calling one of it's intuitevily named static functions, like ```FlightPlanParser.encodeFpl(flightplan, resolveIssues: true)``` or ```FlightPlanParser.parseFpl(source: URL)```.

## WIP
* Support for decoding them from ```.kml``` files.

It worked well in my testing, but if you encounter any issues, you can always PM me on Discord or [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com/u/Alexander_Nikitin).
